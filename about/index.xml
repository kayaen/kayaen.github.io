      <description>I was born and grew up in one of the best city in Turkey: İzmir. I wish to move there again one day in the future.
I graduated with a Bachelors (2015) and a Masters (2018) in Control and Automation Engineering from Istanbul Technical University.
I have various experiences. I started working while I was studying at university. Check my linkedin profile.
I enjoy playing and watching soccer (fan of Beşiktaş), camping, hitchiking, dancing (Forro) and reading about tech.
I&amp;rsquo;m a capoeirista. It is more than a hobby for me. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what is it, check my blog post.
I like to meet new people, travel new places and tasting foods-drinks. I always prefer new experiences.</description>
